# Commercial Licensing

Blux Guard is dual-licensed. You may use it under the open-source Apache License 2.0 for permissive, community use. Commercial use requires a separate commercial agreement.

## When you need a commercial license
Examples include:
- Embedding Blux Guard into a paid or closed-source product.
- Offering Blux Guard or its derivatives as a hosted or managed service.
- Using Blux Guard internally at scale in a proprietary environment where distribution restrictions apply.
- Any monetized deployment that goes beyond the Apache-2.0 terms.
