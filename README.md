## 2. Enhanced Trip-Variable Examples

Deterministic, time-bounded, and auditable

Scenario Trip Condition Enhanced Action
Silent Exfil 10 external sockets to distinct IPs in 60s Block, snapshot process, network quarantine
Mount Surprise SD mounted while locked & charging & idle 12h+ Read-only mount, file checksum verification
Privilege Creep New permission + unknown network connection Permission revert, process quarantine
Process Mimic Same package name, different cert/hash Process freeze, memory capture, hash analysis
UI Hijack Overlay within 2s of credential event Block overlay, user prompt, screenshot capture
Suspicious USB Unknown USB device + file activity Device block, file system scan
Port Scanning Multiple connection attempts to different ports IP blocking, process termination

## 3. Enhanced AI Security Plan â€” "Defending Against Hostile AIs"

Principle: Break a hostile AI's effectiveness by destroying the reliability of its inputs and the economics of its computation â€” always legally, always on your turf.

Strategy I â€” "Pull It Apart Into a Million Directions"

Â· Enhanced Jitter: Deterministic timing variations with behavioral analysis
Â· Proof-of-Work Throttles: Per-UID computational challenges
Â· Advanced Honeypots: Deceptive file systems and network services
Â· Human Validation Gates: Multi-factor confirmation for critical actions

Strategy II â€” "EMP Metaphor" (Safe Isolation)

Â· Circuit Breakers: Application-level air-gapping
Â· Process Snapshotting: Freeze and analyze suspicious processes
Â· Resource Throttling: CPU/QoS limits for suspect UIDs
Â· Hardware Control: USB/BT radio management

Enhanced Defensive Techniques

Â· Behavioral Analysis: Pattern recognition across multiple sensors
Â· Entropy Monitoring: System randomness and fingerprint detection
Â· Integrity Verification: File hash checking and permission validation
Â· Append-Only Audits: Tamper-resistant logging with cryptographic signing

## 4. Enhanced Sensor Usage

Quick Start with Sensors

```python
from blux_modules.sensors import (
    NetworkSensor, DNSSensor, ProcessSensor, 
    FileSystemSensor, PermissionSensor, HardwareSensor, HumanFactorsSensor
)

# Initialize sensors
network_sensor = NetworkSensor()
fs_sensor = FileSystemSensor(watch_dirs=["/tmp", "/home/test"])
process_sensor = ProcessSensor()

# Start monitoring
network_thread = network_sensor.start_monitoring()
fs_observer, fs_thread = fs_sensor.start_monitoring()
process_thread = process_sensor.start_monitoring()

# Perform manual scans
security_status = hardware_sensor.perform_security_scan()
suspicious_files = permission_sensor.find_suspicious_permissions()

# Stop monitoring when done
network_sensor.stop_monitoring()
fs_sensor.stop_monitoring()
process_sensor.stop_monitoring()
```

Real-time Monitoring Features

Â· Continuous Background Monitoring: All sensors run in separate threads
Â· Configurable Intervals: Adjust monitoring frequency as needed
Â· Start/Stop Control: Graceful monitoring management
Â· Security Analysis: Built-in threat detection and risk assessment

4. Integrate with Trip Engine: Connect sensor outputs to rule evaluation
5. Observe Security Events: Monitor logs for detected incidents
6. Connect Companion Devices: BLE/NFC for physical authentication

Â· Comprehensive test logs and simulation results
Â· Peer review with security expert sign-off
Â· Security audit trails for all changes

Operational Safeguards:

Â· Private signing keys stored off-device

Â· No automatic evidence modification or deletion
Â· All actions logged with cryptographic proof
