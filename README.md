## 1. Architecture overview

Sensors → Trip Engine → Decision Layer → Containment → Operator

1. Sensors (data sources)

Network flows, DNS, process lifecycle, filesystem, permissions

Hardware: charging, BT pairing, USB attach

Human factors: unlock patterns, presence windows



2. Trip Engine (deterministic rules)

Boolean and temporal trip-wires

Thresholded counters and state chains

Signed, versioned rule manifests in .config/rules/rules.json



3. Decision Layer

Escalation path: observe → intercept → quarantine → lockdown

Per-UID policies: whitelist / greylist / blacklist

Optional kill-switch for complete isolation



4. Containment & Response

Network interceptor (VpnService-like)

Process isolator / snapshot & rollback

Filesystem quarantine, permission reverter, UI fuse

Signed incident logs in security/logs/



5. Integrity & Anti-tamper

Watchdog with self-heartbeat

Signed binaries & manifests

Alerts on package manager, su binaries, SELinux changes





---

## 2. Trip-variable examples

> Deterministic, time-bounded, and auditable



Scenario	Trip condition	Action

Silent exfil	>10 external sockets to distinct IPs in 60s	block, snapshot, notify
Mount surprise	SD mounted while locked & charging & idle 12h+	read-only + checksum
Privilege creep	new permission soon after unknown net conn	revert + quarantine
Process mimic	same pkg name, different cert/hash	freeze + capture
UI hijack	overlay within 2s of credential event	block overlay + prompt
Cold-start lateral	unknown AUTOSTART after reboot	block autostart until review



---

## 3. AI Security Plan — “Defending against hacker AIs”

Principle:
Break a hostile AI’s effectiveness by destroying the reliability of its inputs and the economics of its computation — always legally, always on your turf.

Strategy I — “Pull it apart into a million directions”

Deterministic jitter to break time-series features

Proof-of-Work throttles (per-UID PoW)

Honeypots and deceptive metadata

Never auto-confirm success — require human validation


Strategy II — “EMP metaphor” (safe isolation)

Circuit breakers to air-gap radios or network routes

Freeze/snapshot suspect processes

Reduce CPU/QoS for suspect UIDs

All actions signed and operator-approved


Defensive, auditable techniques

Per-UID Progressive PoW

Deterministic Adversarial Jitter

Honeypots + Canary Tokens

Silent Alarm + Human Gate

Network Circuit Breaker / Air-gap Mode

Sandboxing & Snapshotting

Adversarial Feedback (bounded)

Fingerprint & Entropy checks

Append-only signed audits



---

## 4. Trip Engine demo (Termux-friendly)

A minimal proof-of-concept located at
security/trip_engine.py.

Setup

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.tripengine ~/.tripengine/incidents
cp .config/rules/rules.json ~/.tripengine/
python security/trip_engine.py
```

Feed events as JSON on stdin:

```bash
echo '{"uid":"com.example.app","network":{"remote_ips_count":60},"device_locked":true}' | python security/trip_engine.py
```

Features

Loads signed rules

Enforces per-UID PoW

Writes signed incidents to security/logs/

Emits silent alert packets (HMAC-signed)



---

## 5. Quickstart test path (safe sandbox)

1. Edit `.config/rules/rules.json` with basic rules.


2. Run trip_engine.py and simulate events.


3. Observe incidents written to security/logs/.


4. Connect a BLE companion (future module) for silent alerts.


5. Iterate thresholds in shadow mode before enabling any blocking.




---

## 6. Governance & ethics

Defensive-only. No offensive payloads.
All commits and rule changes must include:

Author signature

Simulation or test logs

One reviewer sign-off


Private signing keys must never reside on the same device.
Critical changes require a physical ACK (BLE/NFC or manual gesture).


---

## 7. Roadmap

Stage	Goal

v0.1	Termux Trip Engine prototype
v0.2	Honeypot + canary endpoint
v0.3	BLE companion listener
v0.4	Kotlin VpnService interceptor
v0.5	Consensus agent coordinator
v1.0	Full BLUX Guard operator suite



---

## 8. Legal & safety notes

Works only on devices you own or control.

Forensics data remains private and encrypted.

Always test on secondary hardware first.

Never modify or erase evidence automatically.



---


— BLUX Guard Doctrine



---.

Feed isolated honeypots and deceptive metadata to waste training compute.

Rate & cost controls: per-UID Proof-of-Work (PoW), throttling, resource caps.

Starve learning signals: never auto-confirm success; require human validation for sensitive flows.



2. EMP metaphor → safe equivalents (isolation & hard shutdown)

Air-gapping critical systems or temporarily severing nonessential network routes.

Circuit breakers: signed, auditable operator actions to cut radios or engage safe mode.

Freeze & snapshot suspicious processes; deny their I/O while forensics run.

Reduce CPU/QoS for suspect UIDs to deny fine-tuning compute.




## Practical, defensive-only techniques (auditable & legal)

Per-UID Progressive PoW — tunable hardness for bursts (raise cost deterministically).

Deterministic Adversarial Jitter — seeded, signed timing jitter to spoil time-series features.

Honeypots & Canary Tokens — bait attackers and treat hits as high-confidence signals.

Silent Alarm + Human Gate — never give automated confirmation to remote clients; require operator for elevated actions.

Network Circuit Breaker / Air-gap Mode — reversible, signed lockdown for high-confidence compromise.

Sandboxing & Snapshotting — freeze and isolate suspicious compute; snapshot for analysis.

Adversarial Feedback (bounded) — feed low-value deceptive outputs only in isolated honeypots.

Fingerprinting & Model-aware Detection — JA3/TLS fingerprints, timing autocorrelation, entropy checks.

Resource QoS Controls — cap CPU/memory/network on suspect UIDs.

Append-only Audits — signed incident snapshots, encrypted storage, and mirrored offline.


## Legal & ethical line

Three-step, auditable plan to deploy tonight

1. Per-UID PoW + throttle — integrate a CPU puzzle hook in Trip Engine; tune difficulty for bursts.


2. Stand up a honeypot with unique canary tokens — route suspicious traffic there and auto-escalate to quarantine + silent alarm.


3. Add deterministic adversarial jitter — when suspicion > threshold, seed jitter via signed stream for that UID.

## Trip Engine: quick demo & PoW harness (Termux-friendly)

A small Trip Engine demo (Termux/Python) loads rules, accepts JSON events on stdin, evals rules, enforces per-UID PoW, and writes signed incidents. Use it to prototype rules like the AI-beacon and silent-exfil examples. (See examples/ for rules.json and trip_engine.py test harness.)


---

## Prototype & testing path (fast, safe)

1. Create signed rules.json (start unsigned for tests) in ~/.tripengine/.


2. Run the Trip Engine demo and feed JSON events to simulate attacks.


3. Stand up a tiny honeypot in Termux (Flask/busybox) and create .canary/<token> endpoints.


4. Deploy BLE companion listener (Raspberry Pi / spare phone) to receive HMAC alerts.


5. Iterate thresholds in shadow mode, then enable containment actions one by one.




---

## Forensics & evidence to collect on trip

Signed incident snapshot: rule id, timestamps, UID, process tree, binary hashes, socket lists, JA3/TLS fingerprints, DNS queries, PCAP fragment (encrypted).

Append-only signed audit lines; mirror to offline USB.

Preserve canary hits verbatim.



---

## Limitations & safety notes

Hardware-rooted or boot-chain compromised devices can subvert soft defenses; use verified boot + Reterm/SSR to harden base.

Swarm or Trip Engine must never auto-erase / auto-exfiltrate without multi-factor operator ritual.

Test on spare hardware and in shadow mode first.



---

## Roadmap & hardening options

Hardened C signer for audit ledger.

MPD/SSR prototype for capability tokens + attestation.

Kotlin VpnService skeleton for per-UID blocking.

BLE emitter + companion listener (Python) for silent alerts.

Agent coordinator for n-of-m consensus before blocking.

## Governance & ethics

Defensive only. Contributions must respect that boundary.

Rule changes require: author signature, simulation logs, and one reviewer approval.

Keep private signing keys offline; use companion ACKs for critical changes.

Maintain an auditable signed changelog.



---

## Quickstart — test path (tonight)

1. Put the example rules.json in ~/.tripengine/.


2. Run the Trip Engine demo (trip_engine.py) and paste a sample event:
{"uid":"com.example.app","network":{"remote_ips_count":60},"device_locked":true}


3. Observe PoW, incidents written to ~/.tripengine/incidents.log.


4. Start the BLE companion listener on a spare Pi or phone and test the alert flow (use helper to craft base64(payload).base64(hmac) string).


5. Stand up the honeypot .canary/<token> and test canary rule triggering.

Closing — a quiet ode to design

Designing traps is an art: elegant, spare, merciless to the subtle ways systems betray their intentions. Start with half a dozen deterministic trip-lines, sign them, and let them sing warnings in a language only you can read. Build scaffolding so that, when the boogie arrives, it is met by choreography — not panic.

You were a wolf first. Now build walls that respect your hunger and deny the pack.


---

If you want, I’ll generate right now (pick one):

examples/rules.json with the scenarios above, or

trip_engine.py (Termux demo harness with PoW + incident writer), or

ble_companion_listener.py ready for Raspberry Pi (complete with test instructions), or

Kotlin VpnService skeleton for per-UID blocking.


Which artifact shall I craft next?
